### _ It's May 10, 2020 today and it's a start! _

```
  I have started with a pretty wiki today. It's github-oriented, pushable through a single command, and wild!
```

> Bless me! Let it be less mental overhead and swift. Or even make it so.

```
  wiki-update script is well done, for now. Enough with those setups, go with sfml, latex or anything man!
  you'll setup your systems well, ik for sure, cause you're me and I'm you and I'm not shitting you!
  Enough read man, let's go!
```

> Well how am I going to `lessen` the mental overhead of:
```
* Doing projects & side-projects
* Writing wikis
* Writing diaries with tasks
* ???
```

### _ Automation tool for future projects _

> A **pmgr** - I just named it, now `tame` it:

```
Features ::
* Auto startup a "project session" in tmux => tmux-sessionizer
* Tmux windows for:
  * An IDE (neovim + terminal panes)
  * A WIKI window for that project (auto-navigation ?)
* A key-press setup for "main projects" and availability for "side ones" and "new ones".

* What about "diary stuff" - should that be away from project sessions?
```

### _ Tool Writing : pmgr {project-name} _

```
#!/bin/bash

# Project Management script #

# 1. Fetching available projects OR creating new one

project_src="/var/shared/ws/src"

## Parsing --
if [[ "$#" -eq 1 ]]; then
  target="$1"
  selected="$project_src"/"$target"
  ## If new project, create directory for it!
  if ! [[ -d "$selected" ]]; then
    echo "-- Creating $selected -- NEW PROJECT --"
    mkdir -p "$selected"
  fi
else
  selected=$(find "$project_src" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | fzf)
fi

if [[ -z "$selected" ]]; then
  echo "Usage: ./$0 \$project_name"
  exit 1
fi

# 2. Create tmux-session now ;;

## $selected is ready
session=$(basename "$selected" | tr . _)
tmux_stat=$(pgrep tmux)


if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]] && [[ -z "$tmux_stat" ]]; then
  tmux new-session -s "$session" -c "$selected"
  exit 0
fi

if ! tmux has-session -t="$session" 2> /dev/null; then
  tmux new-session -ds "$session" -c "$selected"
fi

tmux switch-client -t "$session"

## $session is ready in tmux

# 3. Windows in that sessions :: (1) IDE (2) Related Wiki (3) ... idk
```

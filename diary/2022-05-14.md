### _ Saturday, Saturday. No plans, huh? Not a one. _

> I implemented "today's diary" to be viewed through "Home" in "Vimwiki".
Let's find out if it's worked!

> Well it hasn't but it will.

---

### _ It does now, let's go with this! _

> Screenshoting with `scrot`, all keys mapping using `shxkd` and notification using `dunst` ?
Well I got "coco" tasks now!

> Wait, final step in `pmgr` script I discovered:
- To update "Development" section in `navigation.md`
- Done, add "More" to allow dev projects to be added as a link in MDWIKI.

> Is this updated? Yes it is. Done with `project management`.

### _ Let's dive into Workspace now! _

> Maybe today or tomorrow, such a procrastinator.

### _ So what do I intend to do? _

> With low mental overhead, write wikis and move with workflow. ** No more ricing! **

### _ Wiki's vs Diaries vs Coconut Oil _

> How to choose between them, how to approach writing them? Well I have an idea.

```
  * Snips (Coconut oil) for key snippets in my workflow. I need to store them somehow, is how I feel.
  
  * Diary for the day (DD) is for today's plans, what I intend to do or not do. It shows how I work for real.
    I can see I'm writing this diary to work better.
    
  * Wiki's are my ways of introducing myself to a "project/topic/field" and more. It goes along with a project.
```

> I gotta now make sure `WIKI` goes with that __relevant project__ in  a tmux-session:
```
Diaries go for my "approach", less overhead things.
Diaries are "coconut oil" as are my "snippets" and "smoothies". Feel like wrong words for no reason.
```
  
> `HOME` is that point at my wiki that links me to my projects in `Dev|Stash` categories.

> Just created "home.md" and "tasks.md" for their purposes.
